## Sidewinder Decryptor
Collection of scripts I've written to decrypt configurations or RAT payloads of Sidewinder

### decrypt-tmp.py
Decrypt the .NET RAT:
```python3 decrypt-tmp.py filename.tmp```

### Note
There's no error-checking of any kind; neither have I used any dependency here. So, any errors should be resolved by manual debugging.
